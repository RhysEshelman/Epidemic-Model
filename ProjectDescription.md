This project works to model an epidemic using people and location objects along with corresponding schedules for them. The program reads in a file containing information like population size, infection rate, employment rate, student status, household size, etc, and outputs a "real time" simulation of the events that occur during the specified runtime.

To see the simulation in action, run the program in a terminal using data.txt as the input like so: java Epidemic data.txt
